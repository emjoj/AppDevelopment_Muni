# Seminar Project

Hi, and welcome to the fourth iteration!

This time we will style our Messagner using CSS.

You can return to Figma. There you have a mobile and desktop layout. (Check the design.)[https://www.figma.com/file/JAZVDDThaK9FHUzoB6f80D/Messenger]

## Your tasks:
1. Create mobile and desktop version using the mobile first approach
2. Use BEM to name your CSS classes and components
3. Use the CSS grid to create the layout

Note:
There will probably be a need to change HTML elements. Focus on BEM - it will help you create the proper HTML structure and suitable classes.
Do not forget to use responsive units - percents, rem, fractions, vw, vh...
