# Seminar Project

Hi, and welcome to the fifth iteration!

In this iteration, we will focus on website optimizations and adding some hover effects.

Your tasks are:
Optimization
1. Have an accessibility score of 100 in Lighthouse for desktop and mobile view
2. Have an SEO score of 100 in Lighthouse for desktop and mobile view
3. Get a high enough number for performance. You cannot achieve 100 in the current setup. But you can get it pretty high.

Graphic improvements
1. When a user hovers over menu items, make them bigger (e.g. 1.3rem) using 500ms transition.
2. Add white background glow to menu items on hover with reasonable transition time.
