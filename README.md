# Seminar Project
This time we will prepare basic stuff for the backend. We will initialize our node project, install typescript, play with the database. Before you start, create a folder messenger-api for this purpose and init Node project using npm.

## Project setup
First, do the basic setup of all dependencies (Use can use a tutorial on Prisma page - start from scratch):
Install typescript and ts-node, and ts-node to start script in package.json.
Install Prisma
Setup database and connection string to DB in .env file

## Development
Add DB schema and models required for your tasks. 
Create main.ts in the src folder. In this file, connect to the DB and do the following:
Insert two contacts into DB.
Insert one message with one contact.
Insert at least five messages with the second contact.
Select the last message with the second contact and write it to the console.

Note: Do not forget to name files and folders correctly. Good structure is the basis of a maintainable project.
