# Seminar Project

Hello, and welcome to the first iteration!

In this iteration, we will create a basic layout for the Messenger application. Our goal is to prepare only HTML and no CSS. You will add CSS in the future. Don't worry about the look - we will use at least the Bootstrap classes.

A designer often uses tools like Sketch, Framer, or Figma to prototype and create UX. In our case, we have a draft prepared in Figma. (Check the design.)[https://www.figma.com/file/JAZVDDThaK9FHUzoB6f80D/Messenger]

In folder ./src/layout create a basic HTML site acording to design. 

It is required to use Emmet in this project. Put the Emmet command you have used into the HTML comment on top of the generated section. We will check it when we review your solution.

Now open your favorite editor and start coding. :)

## Suggestions:

### Document structure:

---
html

head
- meta with encoding (charset utf-8) #with encoding, you ensure the correct display of national characters
- meta with viewport defined (width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0) #this is used to specify scaling on mobile devices

body
---

### Recommended steps:
Create a document and include Bootstrap
Use Grid to define columns
Divide the  left section (2 columns)
- create the main navigation
- create a contact list
Divide the right section (3 rows)
- create navbar with search
- define message view with sample messages
- and finally, add a message input field with buttons
