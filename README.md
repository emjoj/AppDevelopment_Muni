# Seminar Project

Hi, and welcome to the third iteration!

Today you will experiment with XQuery.

## Your tasks:
1. Setup existdb on your machine. Use either local install or Docker.
2. Create a collection in the app folder. Use generated XML from your previous assignment. Insert it into database. 
3. Use XQuery to fill your HTML template with data. Put your XQuery into query.xql file and resulting HTML into index2.html in the mockup folder.

Note:
Split your HTML into logical components and create a template for each component.
If your HTML document looks broken after transformation, you must fix the template.
