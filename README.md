# Seminar Project

Hi, and welcome to the second iteration!

Today you will start preparing the backend for your messenger and test the layout from the first iteration.

## Your tasks:
1. Create an entity diagram for your system. Put it into the diagrams folder in the project root. A readable model is required (png, pdf, svg...)
2. Generate some data in XML (you will need at least contacts, some conversations, and active conversation). Put it into the mockup folder in the project root.
3. Use XSLT to fill your HTML with data. Put your XSLT file and resulting HTML in the mockup folder.

Note:
If your HTML document looks broken after transformation, you must fix the template.
